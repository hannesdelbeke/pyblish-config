# list registered paths

# list registered plugins
# (un)register plugins (add from "browse to module", all plugins in module, or pick one)

# discover

# ideally:
# paths are included in the json file? but then we need relative paths
# choose which plugins to load explicitly, remove all other plugins.

# register plugins like usual, preferably register all plugins you have.
# then load the json to filter plugins to your pipeline
