2 projects BF and FF
share plugins between them with different settings
- collect meshes by name
- validation on meshes with generic plugins
ideally soime valiudation is different per project. ex max polycount
if found over polycount LOD it with simplygon

if a plugin is not optional in your pipeline. mainly reusablility. if author didnt set plug to optional but you want it optional. now you need to change code.
